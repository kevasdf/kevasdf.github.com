	<p>But there are many ways for me to mess things up
	   pushing and pulling my work from different computers.
        </p>
        <p>I can fix whatever I mess up, or I can just start again.
           It is the same with life, to an extent, I hope.

           I really need to figure out how to set up vim on my local
           computers to have syntax highlighting. Even on the school
           server, my vim doesn't have line numbers. These should be
           easy enough to set up, but perhaps I am too tired.
